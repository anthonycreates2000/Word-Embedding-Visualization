Gray Davis is a little mouse!  That about describes most peoples opininion of him.  The power and natural gas situation out here is a mess!  The gas  situation is much worse for us at this point here in Long Beach.  We haven't seen any power outages or any significant increase in our bill either.  The gas front  is an entirely different matter!  I just paid a $300 bill for the month of Dec.   I paid $100 for the same month in 1999.  The usage (therms) was the same............ figure that one out?!?!  At that level I might as well be paying for heating oil in Maine.  Most people I talk to have scene their gas bill go up 2 or 3 fold.  Anyway, things could be a whole lot worse I guess.  Luke just had his 1st birthday party this past weekend.  It was quite the scene.  I think his next party will be when he is 18.  Say hello to Lisa for us.
